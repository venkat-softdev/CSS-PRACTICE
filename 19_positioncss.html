    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> CSS POSITION </h1>
    <hr>
    <h3> Introduction:</h3>
    <li> css position properties are used to control the positioning of elements with the layout of web page. </li>
    <li> they provide flexibility in aligning elemnts relative to their parent container or the view port .</li>
    <h3> key css position properties:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>  static: the default value,where eleemnts are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.</li>
        <li> relative: positions the eleemnts relative to its normal position ,without affecting other elements.</li>
        <li> absolute: positions the elements ralative to the nearest positioned ancestor (other than static).</li>
        <li> fixed: positions the elements relative to the view port ,so its stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.</li>
        <li> sticky : behaves like a combination of realtive and fixed ,sticking to the view port within a certain area.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> 1.Static Position:</h2>
    <ul><li> this is the default positioning for any html eleemnts. it follows the normal flow of the document.</li></ul>
    <div class="static">
        <h2> Static Position </h2>
        <p> Hi Myself Venkat.</p>
    </div>
    <h2> 2.Relative Position:</h2>
    <ul><li> the elements is positioned realtive to its normal position ,without affecting other elements. </li></ul>
    <div class="relative">
        <h2> Relative Position</h2>
        <p> Hi this is venkat</p>
    </div>
    <h2> 3.Fixed Position:</h2>
    <ul><li> the elements is positioned relative to the view port ,so it stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.</li></ul>
    <div class="fixed">
        <h2> Fixed Position</h2>
        <p> This is fixed position.</p>
    </div>
    <h2> 4.Absolute Position:</h2>
    <ul><li> the elements is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (other than static).</li></ul>
    <div class="absolute">
        <div class="box">
            <h2> Absolute Example</h2>
            <p> this elements has absolute position and is positioned relative to its closest positined ancestor , which is the container elements.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2> 5.Sticky Position:</h2>
    <ul><li> the elements behaves like a combination of relative and fixed ,sticking to the viewport within a certain area.</li></ul>
    <div class="sticky">
         <h2>  Sticky Position</h2>
         <p> the elements behaves like a combination of relative and fixed ,sticking to the viewport within a certain area.</p>
         <div class="foc">
             <h2>  Sticky Position</h2>
         <p> the elements behaves like a combination of relative and fixed ,sticking to the viewport within a certain area.</p>
         </div>
